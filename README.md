## About

The New York Times responsive website, extracting data from newsapi.


## Tech stack

* JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, newsapi.org


## Features

Users can:
* Search news article by typing any keyword.
* See articles by category by clicking on navbar/side navbar if it's mobile version.

Other features:
* If images are unavailable/non-existing, show unavailable picture.
* Article uploaded date if the article was published more than 24 hours ago. Otherwise, how many hours ago it was published from now.


## Challenges

Will find another api as this newsapi does not allow deploying non-locally unless it's paid. And there are limited categories.


## Future goals

* Add page nation feature to nevigate easily by page
* Make a distinct main page
